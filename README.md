Several countries struggle with providing easily accessible, inexpensive, and  clean water to its citizens. Tanzania, a developing country, with a population of 57, 000, 000 is one of these countries. As a solution, the government has established wells in numerous places in the country to cater to her citizens

However, the government currently faces a predicament in maintaining the wells as some break down and others fail completely. Therefore, there is need for a means to ensure that the wells that have broken down are repaired and that future wells that are built have reduced if not eliminated break-down possibility. This project oversees the attempt to fill the gap at hand.

## Business Understanding

### Business Problem

The Government of Tanzania wants to repair the wells that have broken down in their country and build new wells with minimized if not eliminated break-down rate. However, they need to identify and locate these wells as well as identify reasons of breakdown for future building.

### Problem Statement

The task at hand is to create a classifier algorithm that predicts the condition of the water well, using information gathered from existing wells.

### Objectives

- To create a classifier algorithm that predicts the condition of a water well
- To predict how likely a well is to break down
- To identify which wells are in need of repair
- To reduce the break-down rate of future wells
